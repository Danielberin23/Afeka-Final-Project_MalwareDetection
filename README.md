## Project Overview

This project, completed in collaboration with Matan Chen, implements a machine learning-based malware detection system. We utilized the `pefile` library to extract features from executable files, creating a custom dataset for training and testing. The project is accessible through a website built with Flask, HTML, and React, and incorporates the VirusTotal API for additional verification of our model's predictions.

## Features

- Machine learning-based malware detection
- Feature extraction using `pefile`
- Custom dataset creation
- Web interface (Flask, HTML, React)
- VirusTotal API integration

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- HTML
- React
- `pefile`
- Scikit-learn


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Danielberin23/Afeka-Final-Project_MalwareDetection.git](https://github.com/Danielberin23/Afeka-Final-Project_MalwareDetection.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Afeka-Final-Project_MalwareDetection


3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install  -r requirements.txt   

## Usage
Launch the Flask application:
Bash
python app.py 
Use code with caution.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port).
Upload a file for malware detection.
View the prediction results and VirusTotal verification.
